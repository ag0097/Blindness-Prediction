<h3>About Dataset</h3>
The dataset has a large set of retina images taken using fundus photography under a variety of imaging conditions.<br>
A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:<br>
0 - No DR <br>
1 - Mild <br>
2 - Moderate <br>
3 - Severe <br>
4 - Proliferative DR <br>

The dataset has noise in both the images and labels. Images may contain artifacts, may be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The images were gathered from multiple clinics using a variety of cameras over an extended period of time, which will introduces further variation.
